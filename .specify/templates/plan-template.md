# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]  
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Dart 3.9 (Flutter stable) + Rust 1.77+ (edition 2021)  
**Primary Dependencies**: `flutter`, `flutter_rust_bridge`, `rust_lib_transparent_wallet`  
**Storage**: Local secure storage (keystore/Keychain); no remote persistence  
**Testing**: `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, `cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml`  
**Target Platform**: iOS, Android, and Flutter web (parity required)  
**Project Type**: Flutter client with embedded Rust FFI crate  
**Performance Goals**: 60 fps UI; ledger sync <2s per account on reference devices  
**Constraints**: Canonical ledger data, no PII telemetry, semver-stable FFI contracts  
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-account consumer wallet; incremental, independently releasable flows

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Ledger transparency: How does work keep ledger data canonical and provide
  deterministic replay fixtures?
- Custody & privacy: Where do secrets live and how are logging/telemetry
  sanitized?
- Platform parity: What is the rollout plan across iOS, Android, and web? Any
  exception MUST include closure criteria.
- FFI discipline: Which Rust APIs change? How will bindings regenerate and how
  are boundary tests updated?
- Test & observability: Which automated suites, metrics, and dashboards prove
  the release safe before cut?

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., Deferred Android parity] | [current need] | [why immediate parity is not viable] |
| [e.g., Ledger cache introduction] | [specific problem] | [why direct chain reads insufficient] |
