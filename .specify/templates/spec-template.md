# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently

  For Transparent Wallet, every story MUST address ledger transparency, custody/privacy impact,
  and cross-platform parity expectations called out in the constitution.
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Capture ledger, custody, and parity risks here.
-->

- How does the flow behave if the ledger node is unreachable or returns stale data?
- What is the user experience when secure storage access fails or is revoked?
- How are parity gaps handled when a capability is missing on one platform?
- What recovery path exists if an FFI call panics or returns an unexpected error?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace each placeholder with concrete, testable requirements.
  Requirements MUST cite how they respect constitution principles (transparency,
  custody, parity, FFI discipline, observability).
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Wallet MUST surface ledger-sourced data for [feature] with documented provenance.
- **FR-002**: Private keys and signing material MUST remain on-device; no remote transmission.
- **FR-003**: iOS, Android, and web MUST expose equivalent UI and error handling for this flow.
- **FR-004**: Rust FFI MUST provide `[function_name]` returning `[DTO]`; bindings regenerated via `flutter_rust_bridge`.
- **FR-005**: Metrics/logging MUST record [event] without leaking PII and ship to approved sinks.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: Ledger update frequency MUST be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., "every 30s"] to satisfy transparency.
- **FR-007**: Android secure storage fallback MUST be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., "StrongBox"] or parity exception filed.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [Ledger DTO, e.g., `AccountSnapshot` with fields and provenance notes]
- **[Entity 2]**: [UI model mirroring DTO, mapping rationale, platform overrides]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [e.g., "User completes transfer with confirmed ledger update in â‰¤60s on reference devices"]
- **SC-002**: [e.g., "Parity validation passes on iOS + Android + web with no blocking gaps"]
- **SC-003**: [e.g., "`flutter test` + integration scenario for this feature passes in CI within 5 min"]
- **SC-004**: [e.g., "No PII captured in telemetry events; observability dashboard confirms signals"]
